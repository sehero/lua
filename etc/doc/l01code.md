thre are code 

e.g. 
nums have mean and sd
syms hae ana analgous cncept mode and etropy

syms and nums are both columns (places to summarize a column
of values)

all cols have a positiion (the column number) and name (txt).
Text has special characters e.g. < means minimizme. else w=1.
 all other
weights are 1

once we have different kinds of columns, we can talk about distances
between differnt types of things.

e.g. sym:dist() and num:dist()

once we can distances tween points, we can distances between rows.

note that paramterization: distance is p (controlled p2,p=1)

not only can we say how far apart are columns, but also, is one
better than other. better is controlled by the w value,
domination

once we can dominate, we can  optimize for a wide range
of goals.  given examples of things with many scores, we can 
do random projections.
