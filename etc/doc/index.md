We explore AI tools (data miners and optimizers) and
how these can be applied to software engineering. Specifically,
we discuss AI support for requirements engineering , test, effort
estimation, defect prediction, etc.

Like Batman and Iron Man, we seek tools that turn ordinary (but
smart) people into super heroes, capable of leaping around hard
problems with a single bound. 
Our super heroes face many foes, so  they know that no single
AI tool will defeat every problem.

Super heroes have super powers. They build their own AI tools, then constantly
tinker and refine them. 
Super heroes have X-ray vision that can see things buried deep inside other things.
So they need treat AI tools as black boxes. Rather, using their super powers
of refactoring, they 
incremental refine, improve, and simplify their AI tools.

Our tools are not CPU nor memory intensive and so scale
to large problems. Also, since injustice
is everywhere our super hero tools  detect,
then mitigate bias in  AI algorithms.

Our tools are described  as a set of weekly coding  challenges
(and we offer supply a baseline solution
for each, written
in Lua). To become a super hero, just recode each challenge in your local
favorite language. These challenges can be used for personnel study,
or as the weekly homeworkds of a graduate class in AI for SE

Like all super heroes, you are highly
inutiative and 
see things others do not. You have
have a deep understanding of your tools and how
they relate to each other. YOu now
