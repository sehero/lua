We explore AI tools (data miners and optimizers) and
how these can be applied to software engineering. Specifically,
we discuss AI support for requirements enigneering, test, effort
estimation, defect prediction, etc.

Like Batman and Iron Man, we seek tools that turn ordinary (but
smart) people into super heroes, capable of leaping around hard
problems with a single bound. 
Our super heroes face many foes, so  they know that no single
AI tool will defeat every problem.

ae 
Our tools are not CPU nor memory intensive and so scale
to large problems. Also, since injustice
is everywhere our super hero tools  detect,
then mitigate bias in  AI algorithms.

But as Linus Torvalds says, "talk is cheap;  show me the code".
Our tools are offered as 15 challenges. We supply a baseline solution
(in Lua) for each challenge and suggest you recode it in your local
favorite language. These challenges can be used for personnel study,
or as the weekly homeworkds of a graduate class in AI for SE

- Lesson 2: check it.

Like all super heroes, you are highly
inutiative and 
see things others do not. You have
have a deep understanding of your tools and how
they relate to each other. YOu now
